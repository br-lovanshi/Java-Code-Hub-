Q4) Explain the difference between the Checked and Unchecked exception?
ans :
1. Checked Exception
: The classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except Error and runtime exception, are called checked exceptions.
the chacked exception is also known as a compile-time exception they are checked by the compiler.
Exp : IOExeption, SQLExeption etc.

2. Unchecked Exception:-
The class that inherits the runtime exception class is known as an unchecked exception. Exm:- NullPointerException,ArethmaticException,InputmismatchException etc.
This is not checked by the compiler by compile time but also checked at runtime.
Runtime Exception is the superclass of all the unchecked exceptions
