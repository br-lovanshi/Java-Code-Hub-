q. Explain upper bounded wildcards and lower bounded wildcards with an example.

ans =>
Upper Bounded :-
1. This is decrease the restriction on a variabels,
2. In class we declare Upper bound char ? using extend keyword,
3. In Interface we declare Upper bound char ? using impelments keyword.

Exm -> List<? extends Number>


Lower Bounded Wildcards :-
1. With the help of Lower Bounded Wildcards we can restrict unknown type to be super type.
2. We can decalred this declaring wildcard character using ("?").
3. We can use "super" keyword for this Lower Bounded wildcard.

Exm -> List<? super Integer>
