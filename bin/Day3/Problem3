Exception :-  Exception is the object of some pre-defined classes created by the JVM when some logical error occur in our application.

there are mainly two type of exceptions in java :-

  1) Logical error :- Some kind of logical mistake in our application that's why JVM will never run our application normally.
2) compiler error :- It is known as syntactical error these kinds of error show as at the compilation.

3.ArrayIndexOutOFBound
4.NumberFormate


For every error there are some predefined classes in java whever the logical error occur JVM will create the object of that perticular class .

1.NullPointerExcepiton :- when our variable length is null and we try to get length().

EXP :- String s = null;
int n = s.length();

 2.ArithmeticException:- When we devide int by 0 it occur this excepiton.

Exp:- 20/0;

3.ArrayOutOFBoundException:- When we try to access the index who's not exist;
Exp :- int [] arr = new int[3];
int a = arr[30];

4.NumberFormateException :- when we try to convert string(a,b,c) to Number.
String s = "s";
int n = Integer.parseInt(s);
